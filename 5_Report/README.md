# WIPER-CONTROL-SYSTEM
## Introduction
These days, even non-luxury compact and family cars are available with rain-sensing wipers. These systems utilize an LED sensor, fitted between the windshield and rearview mirror, to detect the amount of rain or snow falling on the windshield.There are a number of infrared light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and a central photodiode which make up the “rain sense” portion of the system.The invisible light emitted by the LEDs is reflected by the windshield onto the photo sensor. Therefore the more moisture there is on the windshield, the less light the sensor receives. This information is subsequently relayed to a computer control unit, which then adjusts the intermittent wiper delay intervals of the accordingly.The wetter it gets, the faster the rain sensing wipers work to help give you a clear view of what's in front of you. When the system senses drier conditions, such as when the vehicle is stopped at a red light and the rain is falling less intensely, the wipers will gradually slow down before switching themselves off when no longer needed.

## Features
A wiper speed control system for an automotive wiper controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with rain conditions. The control system includes a rain sensor (30) detecting rain conditions to produce . an analog signal having an amplitude depending upon the detected rain conditions.

## COMPONENTS
* STM32
* ARM based microcontroller

## PROCEDURE
* For the ignition of key position the Red LED is ON, if the user button is pressed and held for 2 secs.
* On press of the user input, Blue, Green and Orange LEDs come ON one at a time with the set frequency, The frequency changes on every alternate key press, 3 frequency levels with 1, 4 and 8 Hz.
* The LED glow pattern stops on the 4th press; the wiper action starts next press onwards as mentioned in step 2.
* The Red LED is OFF, if the user button is pressed and held for 2 secs.

## TESTING AND CODING
* Preferable Coding Software for Avr Coding is Microchip studio.
* You have to use C compiler with MINGGW(latest or the previous versions).
* Set path for MINGGW in Environment variables.
* To go with best compiler use CODE BLOCKS.
* In CODE BLOCKS you can also RUN the program in both LINUX and WINDOWS.

## SWOT ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT
## STRENGTHS:
* Easily Operating.
* Platfrom Independant.
## WEAKNESS:
Controlling using WEB.
## OPPORTUNITIES:
Technology maturity may reduce system cost.
## THREATS:
If sensor is damaged ,operation will stops.

## ADVANTAGES
* It helps in saving money by switching off the irrigation system when it rains. This saves money by cutting off bills on electricity consumption.
* It extends life of rain sensor based systems such as car wiper, irrigation systems by running them only when it is necessary.

## DISADVANTAGES
* Smart Wiper Control System uses infrared sensor which is implemented in the latest cars but it has few disadvantages.
* The One is space occupied on the screen is small and the second (main) drawback is need of clear wiping on the windscreen, where the sensor is placed.

## CONCLUSION
* Wiper system is controlled by using STM32 and ARM based microcontroller.

## REFERENCE
* Referred push button to control the LED's of STM32.
